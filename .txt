 commands: 

$ git branch: shows you the brances that are present. (*- star against the name suggest the current branch you are working on). (Whenever you need to check what branch you are currently working on. use this command).

$ git branch newbranchname: this only creates a new branch and not to be confused with *git checkout newbranchname.* 

$ git checkout newbranchname: use this to enter/switch into the new branch stream that you have created or one that is already present.
