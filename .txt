 commands: 

 here we are working with only two branches. Master and mango.

$ git branch: shows you the brances that are present. (*- star against the name suggest the current branch you are working on). (Whenever you need to check what branch you are currently working on. use this command).

$ git branch mango: this only creates a new branch and not to be confused with *git checkout newbranchname.* 

$ git checkout mango: use this to enter/switch into the new branch stream that you have created or one that is already present. 
when ever you want to push your work, push it to the new branch i.e  *$ git push origin mango*. 

To merge two branches:
Rememebr to always git add, commit on the branch you are in. 
 1) $ git checkout master: here we switch to the branch you want to merge with. 

2) $ git merge mango: After exiting the mango branch and into the master branch, we merge the files present in mango branch to the master.

Once done, you can continue working on the master branch. Do $ git push origin master and continue working on master branch. 

note: if you want to delete the mango branch after this, you can do so with the command:
$ git branch -d mango

*Here I am to create a merge conflict for the master branch. *
